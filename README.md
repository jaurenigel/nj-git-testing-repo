# Testing my git-cli (nj-git version 1.0.1) on windows 7

# What does it do?

I am kinda lazy, I want a tool that can create git repo on both remote and local without running:

```
git init
git add .
git -m commit "bla bla"
& so

```

nj-git automates git/github process...by creating both local and remote git repo with one command.

## Try it

```
# to install use npm

npm install -g nj-git

# how to use it

# run nj-git on your terminal

nj-git

# BooM!! check your online repo..that's magic.

```

## Feel free to clone nj-git / contribute & make it better
